#typical example of a Factor 

#Question 3:
#Create a vector and name it gender_vector. The vector should contain
# 7 different genders - "Male", "Male", "female","female", "male", "female", "female"
#Convert the gender_vector to a factor with factor() 
#and assign the result to factor_gender_vector
#Print out factor_gender_vector


#Question 4:
#Create a vector called sex_survey_vector
#Convert the sex_survey_vector to a factor vector and assign the result
# to factor_sex_survey
#Specify the levels of factor_sex_vector with values "Female", "Male"

## Generate a summary for the factor_sex_vector


#Question 5:
# Create a vector called motion_vector and with 7 entries in the following order;
#slow
#medium
#slow
#high
#medium
#slow
#high
# Convert motion_vector to ordered factor vector and name it factor_motion_vector
#Set ordered to TRUE, and set levels to c("slow", "medium", "high").
# Print factor_motion_vector
# Find the summary of factor_motion_vector and print it out
